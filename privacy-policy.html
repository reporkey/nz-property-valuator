<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta">NZ Property Valuator &mdash; Last updated: 21 February 2026</p>

<h2>What this extension does</h2>
<p>
  NZ Property Valuator is a Chrome browser extension that displays property valuation
  estimates alongside TradeMe property listings. When you visit a supported listing page,
  the extension extracts the property address from that page and looks it up on four
  third-party NZ property data services: OneRoof, homes.co.nz, PropertyValue.co.nz,
  and RealEstate.co.nz.
</p>

<h2>Data accessed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Property address strings only.</strong> The extension reads the street address,
    suburb, and city from the TradeMe listing page you are currently viewing. This is the
    only data accessed from your browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    No personal information, browsing history, cookies, login credentials, or any other
    user data is accessed or processed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How address lookups work</h2>
<p>
  Address queries are sent <strong>directly from your browser</strong> to the four
  third-party services listed above. The extension acts as a thin client: it formats the
  address and makes the same API requests that those services&rsquo; own websites make.
  No address data passes through any server we control.
</p>
<p>
  The privacy policies of those third-party services apply to the requests made to them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.oneroof.co.nz/privacy">OneRoof Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://homes.co.nz/privacy">homes.co.nz Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.propertyvalue.co.nz/privacy-policy">PropertyValue.co.nz Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.realestate.co.nz/privacy">RealEstate.co.nz Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Caching</h2>
<p>
  Valuation results are cached <strong>in memory only</strong>, local to the browser
  session, with a 30-minute expiry. Nothing is written to disk, synced to a server,
  or persisted beyond the current browser session. The cache is automatically cleared
  when the extension&rsquo;s service worker is terminated (e.g., after the browser is
  closed or the extension is reloaded).
</p>

<h2>chrome.storage usage</h2>
<p>
  The extension uses <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> to remember which valuation
  sources you have enabled or disabled in the popup. This preference data is synced
  by Chrome across your signed-in devices if you have Chrome sync enabled; it contains
  no personal information, only boolean toggles for each source.
</p>
<p>
  <code>chrome.storage.local</code> is used to cache the most recently fetched
  estimate and timestamp for each source, so the popup can display a summary without
  re-fetching. This data is local to your device.
</p>

<h2>Analytics and tracking</h2>
<p>
  This extension contains <strong>no analytics, no telemetry, no crash reporting, and
  no tracking of any kind.</strong> We do not know how often the extension is used,
  which properties are viewed, or who uses it.
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>storage</strong> — to save your source toggle preferences across sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>host_permissions</strong> for TradeMe, OneRoof, homes.co.nz, PropertyValue, and RealEstate — to make the valuation API requests on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>No other permissions are requested.</p>
