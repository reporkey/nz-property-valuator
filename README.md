# NZ Property Valuator

A Chrome Extension that overlays property valuation data directly onto NZ real estate listing pages.

## Purpose

When browsing a property listing on TradeMe, OneRoof, or RealEstate.co.nz, the extension injects a panel showing valuation estimates sourced from third-party NZ property data providers (homes.co.nz, propertyvalue.co.nz, OneRoof, RealEstate.co.nz), giving buyers quick context without leaving the page.

## Supported sites

Panel is injected on these listing sites:
- trademe.co.nz
- oneroof.co.nz
- realestate.co.nz

## Data sources

Valuation estimates are fetched from:
- OneRoof
- homes.co.nz
- PropertyValue.co.nz
- RealEstate.co.nz
