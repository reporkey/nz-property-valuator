NZ Property Valuator

See instant property valuations from four NZ data sources — OneRoof, homes.co.nz, PropertyValue.co.nz, and RealEstate.co.nz — without leaving your TradeMe listing.

HOW IT WORKS

When you open a TradeMe property listing, a small panel appears alongside the page showing the current estimated value (or value range) from each supported source. Results load in seconds and update incrementally as each source responds.

SOURCES

• OneRoof — New Zealand's largest property data platform, backed by NZME.
• homes.co.nz — Automated valuation model with historical sales data.
• PropertyValue.co.nz — Independent AVM with confidence ratings.
• RealEstate.co.nz — Estimate with low/high range from NZ's leading real-estate portal.

FEATURES

• Instant side-by-side valuations from four sources on every supported listing
• Confidence indicators (high / medium / low) where available
• Direct links to each property's page on the source site
• Toggle individual sources on or off from the popup
• Keyboard-friendly, accessible panel built with Shadow DOM (no style conflicts)
• Works across SPA navigation — stays up to date as you browse between listings

FREE & PRIVATE

• Completely free, no account or sign-in required
• No data collection, no analytics, no tracking of any kind
• All lookups go directly from your browser to the source APIs — nothing passes through our servers
• Open source: github.com/reporkey/nz-property-valuator
