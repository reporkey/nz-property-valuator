Tired of seeing "By Negotiation", "Deadline Sale", or "Price by Application" with no clue what a property is actually worth?

This extension collects price estimates from four NZ property data sources — OneRoof, homes.co.nz, PropertyValue.co.nz, and RealEstate.co.nz — and shows them in a single panel right on the listing page. Works on TradeMe, OneRoof, and RealEstate.co.nz.

💰 Four sources, one page — spot when estimates agree or diverge.
🔒 Free, private, no sign-in, no data collected.
